# datanorm-parser

This repo will shortly contain a Datanorm parser.

DATANORM is a standard used for interchange of article master data.
In Germany it is widely used between suppliers, stores and craft enterprises.

They can contain anything ranging from article numbers over prices to image links. 

Unfortunately there is no open-source parser available. And the Book about the standart is about 100,- which will also not parse your data, but is only for developers.
So i decided to reverse-engineer the DATANORM format and started a first version of a simple parser.
